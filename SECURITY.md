## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security issue, please report it by sending an email to support@blazorise.com

This will allow us to assess the risk and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks!
